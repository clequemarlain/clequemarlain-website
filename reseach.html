      <p>
        My work is motivated by the increasing decentralization of computation
        and services across edge, fog and cloud infrastructures. In such
        systems, agents compete for limited resources and their strategic
        decisions impact both efficiency and fairness. I study these problems
        through the lens of <strong>non-cooperative games</strong> and
        <strong>online learning</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-subtitle">Proportional allocation and the Kelly mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        A central object in my research is the <strong>Kelly mechanism</strong>,
        a proportional allocation rule where users submit bids and receive
        a share of the resource proportional to their bid. I investigate
        extensions of this mechanism under <strong>budget constraints</strong>
        and <strong>α-fair utility functions</strong> (α = 0, 1, 2, ...),
        with the aim of characterising existence and uniqueness of Nash
        equilibria, as well as the efficiency of the resulting allocations.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-subtitle">Learning dynamics in games</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond equilibrium analysis, I am particularly interested in how
        agents <em>learn</em> to play in repeated interactions. I study the
        convergence of different learning rules — such as synchronous
        best-response dynamics, Online Gradient Descent (OGD), Dual Averaging
        (quadratic and entropic) and extra-gradient methods — when they are
        applied to proportional allocation games with budgets.
      </p>

      <p>
        I analyse both the convergence in actions (bids) and the convergence in
        utilities, and I study metrics such as distance to Nash equilibrium,
        price of anarchy and loss of social welfare. I am also interested in
        heterogeneous populations where different groups of agents run
        different learning algorithms contemporaneously.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-subtitle">Edge and fog computing applications</h2>
      <p>
        In the context of <strong>CoGNETs</strong>, I consider scenarios where
        edge resources are offered by infrastructure providers (InPs) and
        shared among mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) or application
        providers. The goal is to design pricing and bidding policies that are
        both practically implementable and grounded in rigorous game-theoretic
        analysis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-subtitle">Simulation tools</h2>
      <p>
        To support the theoretical analysis, I develop a simulation framework
        in <strong>Python/PyTorch</strong> for resource allocation games.
        This framework implements multiple learning dynamics, tracks convergence
        metrics, and produces visualisations (time series, phase plots,
        efficiency/fairness trade-offs). It is designed to be extensible and
        reproducible, and forms part of the research software developed for
        CoGNETs WP3.
